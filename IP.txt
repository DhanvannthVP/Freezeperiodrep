a.IP Plan review

•Below is the data to be filled/corrected by RM. Rest of the fields should be updated only by IP Author.


•Change Number


•Conference Line


•Change Description: - Please refer the description for this release in ServiceNow <CHG #>


•Column  E-F from Section 1 - 6


•Section 1 - Pre-Implementation Tasks


•Check if the service to be deployed has any monitoring set up in eSpud. If so please get those details. If not please fill in those questionnaires' as NA


•Check  the status of Pre-Implementation tasks given.

•If it is completed - No need to take any action. Double check during IP Walkthru.


•If its is open and no duration provided, please check with IP author during IP Walkthru upon who will own the task completion and when it will be executed.



•Section 2 - Deployment Tasks


•Always be sure on who will be assignee for deployment tasks


•RCO DDO(Distributed Deployment Team)


•This team will take care of UNIX/LINUX Services Stop/Start tasks


•Staging rpm to MAMSITE


•Generic service such as copying from one path to other


•DML changes in DBA tasks


•Separate ctask required for each tab present in IP Plan


•Not required/needed for IP Walkthru.


•UNIX Team


•Installing service once existing service is stopped by RCO DDO team


•They will not do such things for HP servers (epl*)


•One single ctask is enough for this team.


•Send out separate email 2 days prior to deployment for IP review and resource allocation.

• Unix On Call Schedule •Engage the Primary first
•If no response then give them 10 mins to respond
•If no response again, make one last attempt to engage them again
•If unsuccessful, then engage the secondary on call and follow the same process for steps 1-3
•If unsuccessful with Primary and Secondary, then escalate to the group mgr. (This would be at the 1 hr. mark)
•The on call person should respond for engagement without the need for a INC as well. We accounted for their potential involvement, engaged them with a c-task and now need them and they are unavailable. Once they join, they can track their work thru the C-Task on the CHG.


•HP Team


•They will do stop/start, installation of rpm`s under HP team`s control (servers starting with epl*)


•HP Team require 8 days prior notification of the change from release date. Failing to do so will lead to penalty.


•CTask is enough. Master ticket can be created 8 days ahead and they need to be involved during IP Walk-through.


•DBA Team


•Any object level changes except DML changes can be done by this team


•Any DB Refresh task can be assigned to DBA team


•Similar to HP team, this team also requires 8 days advanced notification and request creation.


•ITSR form and request creation is DEV team`s responsibility. Please provide DEV team with CHG # for request # alone.


•TWS scheduling team


•Any task involving TWS scheduling change.


•2 days prior notification required.
